# ART BIBLE

Hi, I'm David, a student at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. I have done a research on how to make an Art Bible during the realization of my second college career project.
## General Tips
### What's an Art Bible?

An Art Bible is a document created by the Art Director to communicate to the art team exactly what style the art assets should match. Its main objective is to establish a guide document that contains the details of what the game is going to look. This document is created after the Game Design Document (GDD) and before any art production. 

### Principal Objectives
The reason why this document is made has a serie of objectives that it tries to fulfill:
* Explain the idea of art that will appear in our videogame
* Consistency during art production
* Helps the team understand the idea they want to make
* It makes faster the decisions that will be made
* Help new members adapt faster to work
* Help in marketing and communication
     
### Main points to take into account while doing an Art Bible
* Target Audience
* Important ideas to new members
* Understandable tips to all art members
* Clarify information ton our sponsors
     
### Sources to help explain your Art Bible
* Concept Art
* Photograpy
* Simple Models
* Diagrams
* Completed Assets
* Work from other media
