# ART BIBLE

Hi, I'm David, a student at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. I have done a research on how to make an Art Bible during the realization of my second college career project.
## General Tips
### What's an Art Bible?

An Art Bible is a document created by the Art Director to communicate to the art team exactly what style the art assets should match. Its main objective is to establish a guide document that contains the details of what the game is going to look. This document is created after the Game Design Document (GDD) and before any art production. 

### Principal Objectives

The reason why this document is made has a serie of objectives that it tries to fulfill:
* Explain the idea of art that will appear in our videogame
* Keep consistency in all the artistic elements of the game
* Help the team get an idea of the game that is going to be done
* Doubts are answered faster because we establish a series of guidelines
* Help new members adapt faster to work
* Help the marketing and communication sectors understand the game that is being done
     
### Main points to take into account while doing an Art Bible
* Target audience we want to reach
* This document should make clear the most important ideas to new members
* It must be a document that clarifies all the doubts of the members of the group
* Make clear the concept of the game that you want to create to our sponsors
     
### Sources to help explain your Art Bible
* Concept Art
* Photograpy
* Simple Models
* Diagrams
* Completed Assets
* Work from other media

### First steps to keep in mind

While creating the document, it is important to remember some tips:
* Adding a lot of text can complicate an explanation, it is much better to resort to visual content
* Agree the formats and tools that best suit the team
* Add small descriptions to the images and highlight important parts
* You can add priorities about the importance of a certain artistic element and/or a step-by-step list of how to make a certain element

### in case of limited/no art background
* Gather and include good reference examples
* Prepare color palettes in the images that best suit your purpose
* Explore several art reference websites, such as: [Pinterest](www.pinterest.com), [ArtStation](www.artstation.com), [Deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/)...
