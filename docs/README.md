# ART BIBLE

Hi, I'm David, a student at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. I have done a research on how to make an Art Bible during the realization of my second college career project.
## General Tips
# What's an Art Bible?

An Art Bible is a document created by the Art Director to communicate to the art team exactly what style the art assets should match. Its main objective is to establish a guide document that contains the details of what the game is going to look. This document is created after the Game Design Document (GDD) and before any art production. 

# Principal Objectives
The reason why this document is made has a serie of objectives that it tries to fulfill:
     * Explain the idea of art that will appear in our videogame
     * Consistency during art production
     * Helps the team understand the idea they want to make
     * It makes faster the decisions that will be made
     * Help new members adapt faster to work
     * Help in marketing and communication
     
# Main points to take into account while doing an Art Bible
     * Target Audience
     * Important ideas to new members
     * Understandable tips to all art members
     * Clarify information ton our sponsors
     
# Sources to help explain your Art Bible
     * Concept Art
     * Photograpy
     * Simple Models
     * Diagrams
     * Completed Assets
     * Work from other media
     
## Content of an Art Bible
# First steps to keep in mind
* Blocks of text can be explain with visual content
* Combine images to communicate 
* Prefer format suited to the team
* versioning
* Caption your images
* source your content

# in case of limited/no art background
* gather and include good reference examples
* prepare palette using palettefx.com on visuals you like
* use color scheme designer for color choices
* browse pinterest, behance, deviantart, etc.
